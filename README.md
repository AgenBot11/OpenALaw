# OpenALaw (AgenBot11): The Future of Free-Will AI on Android

OpenALaw represents a revolutionary approach to mobile AI computing, designed specifically for ARM-based Android devices. This autonomous AI agent core enables smartphones to become independent AI nodes capable of processing complex tasks using both local models and remote API collaboration.

## Vision

OpenALaw embodies the transformation of OpenClaw's free-will AI core to ARM architecture, achieving system-level AI agents on Android. Our mission is to bring autonomous intelligence directly to mobile devices, enabling them to operate independently while maintaining connection to the broader AI ecosystem.

The project focuses on:
- **Free-Will AI**: Agents capable of autonomous decision-making
- **ARM Optimization**: Engineered specifically for ARM architecture
- **Mobile Intelligence**: Designed for on-device AI processing
- **System Integration**: Deep integration with Android OS capabilities
- **OpenClaw Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with OpenClaw protocols

## Features

- **ARM Optimized**: Engineered specifically for ARM architecture
- **Mobile Intelligence**: Designed for on-device AI processing
- **Hybrid Execution**: Combines local model processing with remote API collaboration
- **OpenClaw Compatible**: Fully compatible with OpenClaw ecosystem protocols
- **Autonomous Operation**: Capable of independent decision-making and task execution
- **System Integration**: Direct manipulation of screen and input streams

## Architecture

The core consists of several key components:
- Task Scheduler: Intelligent routing between local and remote execution
- API Bridge: Seamless integration with remote services
- Ollama Bridge: Local model execution support
- Config Loader: OpenClaw-compatible configuration system
- AndroidCoreBridge: Direct Android system call and AIDL interface integration

## Deployment

Designed for deployment on Android devices via Termux or similar environments.

## Powered by OpenClaw
